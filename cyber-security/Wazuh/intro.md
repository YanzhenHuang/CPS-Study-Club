## How Wazuh works

Wazuh consists of:

**Wazuh agent** - endpoint security agent installed on host

**Wazuh server** - analyze data from the Wazuh agent, process this data and matches it against **rule-sets** to identify **indicators of compromise**

**Elastic stack** - displays and indexes the alerts generated by the wazuh server, provides robust data visualization and analysis functionality

*Wazuh can also collect log from network devices to monitor them without installing the wazuh agent

## Deploying wazuh

There are two ways:

1. All-in-one, Wazuh server and ELK stack are installed and configured on the same system (OVA file that can be setup on local network)
2. Distributed, the component is separated, for large environment for the purpose of scalability

Just take reference from here: https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/
